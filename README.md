# WebVisualization

This project puts the plots created in the "weatherpy" project to use by using them to build a web page.

index.html loads the initial summary page.  From here, we could jump to one of the individual visualization pages either by the plots drop-down menu or by clicking the appropriate chart in the "Visualizations" panel.

A "comparison" page display all four chart visualizations.  This page allows navigation to the individual visualization pages as well by clicking on the chosen chart.

A "data" page shows the data used to build the plots.  And finally, a soupcon of "l'attitude" allows a return to the initial page from any other page.

Elements of all pages are designed to be responsive to changes in web page window size.
